## Idea

## TODO
Final submission 10am sun \
## further feature ideas
route statistics comparison (speed, number of holds) of your results to local climbing gym peers on same route \
NFC linking with climbing route  \

## Libraries used:
react-player \
react-p5

## vision

Imagine you are stuck at a difficult boulder problam,
you grab a local pro climber, mammut climbax and your smartphone camera
let the pro climber wear climbax and film his (successfull) attempt at solving the boulder.
\
Afterwards you can see which move he made at which position and how he oriented his hands . This should help you in solving it on your own.
\
If you then wear the climbax on your attempt and fail, you could get feedback, where your attempt differed from the pro´s solution. This could guide you in one possible solution or show you what is still missing in your training plan
\
When you are done solving the boulder, you also have great content to share on your social media with additional info about the route, your hand placement as well as height,
making it easier to understand even for non pro climbers.
\
We can imagine a situation in the future where also gyroscope data is analyzed, to recreate a 3d version of the entire route.
\
For that it could also be beneficial experimenting with two more Climbax sensors to track the feet movements as well because climbers rely on every limb to solve a problem and combined with additional gyroscope data this could result in an amazing 3d digital twin of a climbed route.
\
Apart from being an artwork in itself, digital route representations could also go hand in hand with climbing gyms using Climbax tracker to map their own routes and implementing a gamification model, where users collect digital route badges once they finish climbing a route.
\  A fun incentive for climbers to beat all the routes, win all the climbing hall´s badges and compete against the local champions, similar to pokemon ;)
